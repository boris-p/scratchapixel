# Schedule for the Nvidia interview.
Maybe this will change and maybe i'll do much less.
I asked the interviewer what the interview is going to be about, if she'll answer i'll make adjustments here

but if not my plan is to focus on coding problems and algorithms.
So I build this plan as a short refreshed course.

It's important to remember that as some point I did all these things, wrote 
those algorithms and data structures.

The other, more important thing for me to remember and focus on is to enjoy this.
I usually really don't enjoy this, it's a painful process and one where I really feel stupid in, but it 
shouldn't. I don't need to work too hard, I need to be calm, learn a bit and let go.

The schedule I prepared is for 5 days, I probably won't maaage to do everything I wrote here
and that is OK.
Whatever happens, whatever I feel during, I need to remind myself that this is all ok.
At least for the first 3 days, i'm limiting the amout of time I spend on this for 3 hours. 
I can spend less time but not more. 
If something takes a long time or i'm starting to feel frustrated, just look at the answers.

These are the rules.

It might seem a bit silly to waste time on writing this thing instead of actually doing
productive things, but this is part of not apologising for how I feel and aligning expectations,
so this is productive, and until I manage to not have these feelings that stop me from 
just thinking about what i'm trying to solve, I sometimes need to remind myself this.

A really good youtube channel I found is called neetcode
