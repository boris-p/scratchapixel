In his eyes, what is the purpose of the team, what is the team trying to solve?

Is the team small or large?

If he can talk about how features are assigned, the day to day.

Everyone basically doing everything or is there a clear division or responsibilities between the people.

A few example of tasks/ projects?

Usual time span for tasks 

review process

who are the clients and is there a direct connection with them?

been at the company for a long time. General thoughts about the company, company's thoughts on mobility (also considering relocation, is this an option), what are his thoughts on this group compared to others in terms of focus.

I understood the team is all across the world, how does this work in terms of meetings, syncs, reviews

if he could talk a bit about the different people in the team. How many, responsibilities.

Does the job include travelling to other teams from time to time? And connection to other companies - I saw he did a lot of work with Unreal in the past

## Leland Jobson 

If it's not too personal, was wondering what his motivation is in joining the team and 
if this job is 100% technical or also has some say in the product, bringing 
ideas related to the AEC space.

In his eyes, what is the purpose of the team, what is the team trying to solve?

How is the day to day, in terms of tasks, review process, languages used.

If he can say a few words about the team.
