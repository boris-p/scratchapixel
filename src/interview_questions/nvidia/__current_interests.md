Very interested in creating tools relating to the AEC space,
and if to narrow it down even more relating to sustainability and climate/ enegy simulations.

Creating tools to make simulations and visualizations more accesible and intuitive.
the whole field of edge computing
Computer graphics, had some more traditional CV work 
in my previous company and just looking at both software and hardware improvements and new methodologies that enable a new generation of tools to help people design spaces. 
So i'm really excited about problems in that domain, about building something that relates to the physical world.
vp/ar and tangible interfaces.

technology - webassembly, ml

Having the option to design systems in high scale, taking the time and research how to approach tasks - so tasks that don't always have a clear answer and involve some sense of uncertainty and research on how to approach them/ do them.

Learning from other people and working in conjunction with technically strong people.
